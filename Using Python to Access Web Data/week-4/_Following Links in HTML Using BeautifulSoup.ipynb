    "# Following Links in Python\n",
    "In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllinks.py.\n",
    "The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags,\n",
    "scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, \n",
    "follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the name for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html\n",
    "Find the link at position 3 (the first name is 1).\n",
    "Follow that link. Repeat this process 4 times.\n",

    "Find the link at position 18 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 7 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: The first character of the name of the last page that you will load is: F\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy\n",
    "The web pages tweak the height between the links and hide the page after a few seconds to make it difficult for you to do the assignment without writing a Python program. But frankly with a little effort and patience you can overcome these attempts to make it a little harder to complete the assignment without writing a Python program. But that is not the point. The point is to write a clever Python program to solve the program.\n",
